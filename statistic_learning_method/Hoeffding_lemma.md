# Statement of the Lemma
Let $X$ be any real-valued random variable with expected value $E(x)=0$, and such that $a \leq X \leq b$ almost truely,  Then, for all $\lambda \in R $,
$$ E[e^{\lambda X}] \leq \left\{  \frac{\lambda^2 (b-a)^2}{8} \right\}$$
Note that because of the assumption that the random variable $X$ has zero expectation,  the $a$ and $b$ in the lemma must satisfy $a \leq 0 \leq b$.
